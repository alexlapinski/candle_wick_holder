Updated 2021-05-16. Improvements for internal thread leadin, aligning
thread triangulation ("facets") with base cylinder triangulation. 
Thanks, jeff spirko, rambetter!

Here are modules to draw accurate, ISO-standard threads in OpenSCAD
<https://dkprojects.net/openscad-threads/openscad.org>. The
specification comes from Wikipedia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_screw_thread>.


    OpenSCAD modules

There are two front-end modules:

  * metric_thread (diameter, pitch, length)
  * english_thread (diameter, threads_per_inch, length)

metric_thread() input units are millimeters. english_thread() inputs are
in inches, though the drawing dimensions are in millimeters.

There are several optional parameters that can be used with either of
these modules:

  * internal=true. Indicates that an internal thread (e.g., for a nut)
    will be drawn. Internal threads should be "cut out" from a solid
    using difference(). The default (internal=false) indicates that
    external threads (e.g., for a bolt) will be drawn. (The clearances
    for internal and external threads are different. See Wikipedia
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_screw_thread>.)
  * n_starts=1 (default). This provides the option to draw /multi-start/
    threads. These have two or more "parallel grooves" for the threads.
    For example, the DNA double-helix has two "starts". I used this
    option to create a sprocket
    <http://www.shapeways.com/model/684970/rohloff-13-tooth-sprocket.html>
    for a Rohloff 14-speed bicycle hub, which has a proprietary
    six-start metric thread.
  * square=true. (default: false). Standard square threads (per
    Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_thread_form>).





  * thread_size=N. (default: same as pitch). Non-standard. This option
    allows the size of a single thread "V" to be specified independently
    of the pitch ("travel" per turn). In this example, the pitch is 4
    mm, but the thread size is 1 mm.




  * groove=true. (default: false) Non-standard. Draws the thread as an
    inverted "V" subtracted from the "bolt cylinder". In this example,
    the pitch is 4 mm and the thread size is 1 mm (as in the previous
    example), but groove is set true.




  * rectangle=RATIO. (default: 1). Non-standard. Specifies a "square"
    thread that is actually a rectangle. In this example,
    rectangle=0.333 - the "height" of the thread is one-third of its
    "width." In addition, the pitch is 8 mm while the thread size is 6
    mm, and groove is set to true.


  * angle=DEG (default: 30). Non-standard. Specifies the angle of the
    thread side measured from a line perpendicular to the thread axis.
    The default 30 degrees is the ISO standard.
  * taper=diameter/length (default: 0). The amount of taper as change in
    diameter per length. The NPT standard is 1 inch change in diameter
    per 16 inches length.
  * leadin=N (default: 0). Chamfer end of threads. 0: no chamfer; 1:
    chamfer at max-z end; 2: chamfer at both ends; 3: chamfer at z=0 end.

*Note: left-hand threads*. While there is no option for left-hand
threads, such "reverse" threads are easy to create in OpenSCAD â€“ use the
"mirror
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#mirror>"
command to "flip" the part across a plane.

This module, which uses a polyhedron for each segment of the thread, was
inspired by Trevor Moseley's work
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27183>, although the results there do
not appear to adhere to the ISO standards (especially with regard to
required clearances).
